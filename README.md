# osticket-html-emails
Allows for HTML emails to be configured and sent from osTicket. Does not currenty allow for email replies.

**NOTE**: This plugin is in *beta*. It works for me, however you may find your own set of issues or a use-case I have not considered. I am very happy to take pull requests :)

## Requirements:
* PHP 5.6 or higher
* osTicket 1.10 or higher

Also requires that `includes/class.Mailer.php` be writable by osTicket.
